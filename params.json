{"name":"Andalay","tagline":"Data layer for angular projects","body":"# Andalay #\r\n\r\nA data layer modelled on Backbone collection and models. For use with Angular JS.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n- Form a data layer that syncs with a backend (restfull or otherwise, the way browsers are going it wouldnt be surprising to have a local database type object in the future that does this for us, in which case Andalay might form a default standard interface perhaps)\r\n- Creates a local object cache reducing server load. For example a collection.find(123) request would first search the local objects in the collection and if not found would then ask the server.\r\n- Makes working with collections of models easier\r\n- Enables active record style objects. Each item in the collection is in fact a model that can have convenience functions\r\n- Make it easy to locally search through collections and models\r\n\r\n## To Develop\r\n\r\n1. ```git clone git@bitbucket.org:newicon/angular-andalay.git```\r\n2. ```cd angular-andalay```\r\n3. ```npm install```\r\n\r\nTo run the tests:\r\n\r\n- ```npm test``` - run through the tests once and exit.\r\n- ```karma start``` - runs the tests and reruns them when any development file is changed note you will need to install karma ```npm install karma -g```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-33348035-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
